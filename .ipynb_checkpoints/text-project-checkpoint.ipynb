It expects 350 people to attend this year’s event, and raise about $1,400,000, according to a permit filed with the town of Palm Beach, Fla.\\nPalm Beach fundraisers for hospitals are nothing new, but this year’s galas have generated more discord because of what many see as a disconnect between the hospitals’ missions and the impacts of President Trump’s executive order on immigration.\\nHundreds of medical students and faculty members signed a petition urging Dana-Farber to move this year’s fundraiser for that reason. “The executive order is a direct threat to the health and well-being of thousands of refugees worldwide who are fleeing violence and persecution by denying them consideration for refugee status in the United States,” it reads. The activists will also hold a demonstration on Saturday at Harvard Medical School. \\n\\nAbout the Author\\nGeneral Assignment Reporter\\nIke is a general assignment reporter.\\n Tags\\n\\n\\n'"

    "# Explore TFIDF\n",
    "### So far we have 3 important variables: news_df for all the news, articles for list/corpus of all articles, and vocab_df for the vocabularies of the articles\n",
    "Now, I will explore TFIDF to extract keywords and try to match them to a categorizing model. This mapping can perhaps compare the results of the two algorithms. Many of the columns I populated above are not used, but they are interesting to look at and can be features in future models!<br><br>\n",
    "Quoted directly from http://brandonrose.org/clustering#Stopwords,-stemming,-and-tokenizingHere.<br>\n",
    "\"I define term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) vectorizer parameters and then convert the synopses list into a tf-idf matrix. To get a Tf-idf matrix, first count word occurrences by document. This is transformed into a document-term matrix (dtm). This is also just called a term frequency matrix. An example of a dtm is here at right. Then apply the term frequency-inverse document frequency weighting: words that occur frequently within a document but not frequently within the corpus receive a higher weighting as these words are assumed to contain more meaning in relation to the document. A couple things to note about the parameters I define below: <br>-- max_df: this is the maximum frequency within the documents a given feature can have to be used in the tfi-idf matrix. If the term is in greater than 80% of the documents it probably cares little meanining (in the context of film synopses) <br>-- min_idf: this could be an integer (e.g. 5) and the term would have to be in at least 5 of the documents to be considered. Here I pass 0.2; the term must be in at least 20% of the document. I found that if I allowed a lower min_df I ended up basing clustering on names--for example \"Michael\" or \"Tom\" are names found in several of the movies and the synopses use these names frequently, but the names carry no real meaning. <br>-- ngram_range: this just means I'll look at unigrams, bigrams and trigrams.\""
